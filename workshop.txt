[h1]MetricZ — server-side mod for DayZ[/h1]

[b]Where to install:[/b] [u]server only[/u].
Do [i]not[/i] install on clients — it does nothing on the client.

[hr][/hr]

[h2]What it is[/h2]
A simple observability and monitoring mod for DayZ server admins. It collects server and world [i]metrics[/i] (player count, FPS, weather, vehicles, events) and writes a Prometheus-compatible [i]textfile collector[/i] output to `metricz.prom`. Point [i]node_exporter[/i] or [i]windows_exporter[/i] at this file to let Prometheus scrape it. Visualize with Grafana using PromQL. Works with Prometheus-compatible TSDB backends (Prometheus, VictoriaMetrics, Mimir, Cortex, Thanos) for scalable telemetry.

[b]Does not change gameplay[/b] and adds no items or loot.

[h2]Quick install[/h2]
[olist]
[*]Add the mod to your DayZ server load order

[h2]Complete your stack with LogZ[/h2]
To get the full picture, use [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3610709966]LogZ[/url][/b] alongside MetricZ.
[list]
[*] [b]MetricZ[/b] tracks [i]metrics[/i] (How many players? What is the FPS? How many cars?)
[*] [b]LogZ[/b] tracks [i]logs[/i] (Who killed whom? Who built what? Where did they disconnect?)
[/list]
Together they allow you to correlate server performance drops with specific player events in Grafana.
